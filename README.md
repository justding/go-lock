## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project provides a **Makefile** for testing / generating / building the project.

### Installation
 
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/stoex/go-lock.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```sh
make deps
```
3. Generate Code
```sh
make gen
```
4. Start up a redis instance
```sh
make redis
``` 
5. Build the project
```sh
make all
```

Please see `make help` for a list of available commands.

### Configuration

The program uses environment variables and CLI flags for configuration. To specify which redis clients should be used to connect please specify the following variable:

```sh
REDIS_CLIENTS=redis://...,redis://...,redis://...
```

The variable should be used as a comma separated list - you can specify however many clients you wish to connect to.
During development you can also use a `.env` file like so:

```sh
echo 'REDIS_CLIENTS=...' > .env
``` 

The `.env` file should be placed in the same directory the server is run from.

## Usage

See the servers available parameters with `go-lock -h`.

> Note: if `-cert_file` or `-key_file` are not used in conjuction with `-tls`the server uses certificates from `google.golang.org/grpc/testdata` instead.
